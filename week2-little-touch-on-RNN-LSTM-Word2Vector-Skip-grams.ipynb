It’s unclear how a traditional neural network could use its reasoning about previous events in the film to inform later ones.</p>\n",

A loop allows information to be passed from one step of the network to the next.</p>\n",
       "<p>These loops make recurrent neural networks seem kind of mysterious. However, if you think a bit more, it turns out that they aren’t all that different than a normal neural network. A recurrent neural network can be thought of as multiple copies of the same network, each passing a message to a successor. Consider what happens if we unroll the loop:</p>\n",

       "<p>This chain-like nature reveals that recurrent neural networks are intimately related to sequences and lists. They’re the natural architecture of neural network to use for such data.</p>\n",
       "<p>And they certainly are used! In the last few years, there have been incredible success applying RNNs to a variety of problems: speech recognition, language modeling, translation, image captioning… The list goes on. I’ll leave discussion of the amazing feats one can achieve with RNNs to Andrej Karpathy’s excellent blog post, <a href=\"http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/\">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks</a>. But they really are pretty amazing.</p>\n",
       "<p>Essential to these successes is the use of “LSTMs,” a very special kind of recurrent neural network which works, for many tasks, much much better than the standard version. Almost all exciting results based on recurrent neural networks are achieved with them. It’s these LSTMs that this essay will explore.</p>\n",

If RNNs could do this, they’d be extremely useful. But can they? It depends.</p>\n",
       "<p>Sometimes, we only need to look at recent information to perform the present task. For example, consider a language model trying to predict the next word based on the previous ones. If we are trying to predict the last word in “the clouds are in the <em>sky</em>,” we don’t need any further context – it’s pretty obvious the next word is going to be sky. In such cases, where the gap between the relevant information and the place that it’s needed is small, RNNs can learn to use the past information.</p>\n",

       "<img src=\"img/RNN-shorttermdepdencies.png\" alt>\n",
       "</div>\n",
       "<p>But there are also cases where we need more context. Consider trying to predict the last word in the text “I grew up in France… I speak fluent <em>French</em>.” Recent information suggests that the next word is probably the name of a language, but if we want to narrow down which language, we need the context of France, from further back. It’s entirely possible for the gap between the relevant information and the point where it is needed to become very large.</p>\n",
       "<p>Unfortunately, as that gap grows, RNNs become unable to learn to connect the information.</p>\n",

       "<p>In theory, RNNs are absolutely capable of handling such “long-term dependencies.” A human could carefully pick parameters for them to solve toy problems of this form. Sadly, in practice, RNNs don’t seem to be able to learn them.

       "<p>Long Short Term Memory networks – usually just called “LSTMs” – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. They were introduced by <a href=\"http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/pdfs/Hochreiter97_lstm.pdf\">Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber (1997)</a>, and were refined and popularized by many people in following work.<a href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref1\"><sup>1</sup></a> They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems, and are now widely used.</p>\n",

       "<h2 id=\"step-by-step-lstm-walk-through\">Step-by-Step LSTM Walk Through</h2>\n",
       "<p>The first step in our LSTM is to decide what information we’re going to throw away from the cell state. This decision is made by a sigmoid layer called the “forget gate layer.” It looks at <span class=\"math\">\\(h_{t-1}\\)</span> and <span class=\"math\">\\(x_t\\)</span>, and outputs a number between <span class=\"math\">\\(0\\)</span> and <span class=\"math\">\\(1\\)</span> for each number in the cell state <span class=\"math\">\\(C_{t-1}\\)</span>. A <span class=\"math\">\\(1\\)</span> represents “completely keep this” while a <span class=\"math\">\\(0\\)</span> represents “completely get rid of this.”</p>\n",

       "<p>The next step is to decide what new information we’re going to store in the cell state. This has two parts. First, a sigmoid layer called the “input gate layer” decides which values we’ll update. Next, a tanh layer creates a vector of new candidate values, <span class=\"math\">\\(\\tilde{C}_t\\)</span>, that could be added to the state. In the next step, we’ll combine these two to create an update to the state.</p>\n",
       "<p>In the example of our language model, we’d want to add the gender of the new subject to the cell state, to replace the old one we’re forgetting.</p>\n",

       "<p>We multiply the old state by <span class=\"math\">\\(f_t\\)</span>, forgetting the things we decided to forget earlier. Then we add <span class=\"math\">\\(i_t*\\tilde{C}_t\\)</span>. This is the new candidate values, scaled by how much we decided to update each state value.</p>\n",

       "<p>For the language model example, since it just saw a subject, it might want to output information relevant to a verb, in case that’s what is coming next.

       "<p>One popular LSTM variant, introduced by <a href=\"ftp://ftp.idsia.ch/pub/juergen/TimeCount-IJCNN2000.pdf\">Gers &amp; Schmidhuber (2000)</a>, is adding “peephole connections.” This means that we let the gate layers look at the cell state.</p>\n",

       "</div>\n",
       "<p>The above diagram adds peepholes to all the gates, but many papers will give some peepholes and not others.</p>\n",
       "<p>Another variation is to use coupled forget and input gates. Instead of separately deciding what to forget and what we should add new information to, we make those decisions together. We only forget when we’re going to input something in its place. We only input new values to the state when we forget something older.</p>\n",
       "<div style=\"width:90%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; margin-bottom:8px; margin-top:8px;\">\n",
       "<img src=\"img/LSTM3-var-tied.png\" alt>\n",
       "</div>\n",
       "<p>A slightly more dramatic variation on the LSTM is the Gated Recurrent Unit, or GRU, introduced by <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1078v3.pdf\">Cho, et al. (2014)</a>. It combines the forget and input gates into a single “update gate.” It also merges the cell state and hidden state, and makes some other changes. The resulting model is simpler than standard LSTM models, and has been growing increasingly popular.</p>\n",

       "</div>\n",
       "<p>These are only a few of the most notable LSTM variants. There are lots of others, like Depth Gated RNNs by <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.03790v2.pdf\">Yao, et al. (2015)</a>. There’s also some completely different approach to tackling long-term dependencies, like Clockwork RNNs by <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3511v1.pdf\">Koutnik, et al. (2014)</a>.</p>\n",
       "<p>Which of these variants is best? Do the differences matter? <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.04069.pdf\">Greff, et al. (2015)</a> do a nice comparison of popular variants, finding that they’re all about the same. <a href=\"http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/jozefowicz15.pdf\">Jozefowicz, et al.

       "<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n",
       "<p>Earlier, I mentioned the remarkable results people are achieving with RNNs. Essentially all of these are achieved using LSTMs. They really work a lot better for most tasks!</p>\n",
       "<p>Written down as a set of equations, LSTMs look pretty intimidating. Hopefully, walking through them step by step in this essay has made them a bit more approachable.</p>\n",
       "<p>LSTMs were a big step in what we can accomplish with RNNs. It’s natural to wonder: is there another big step? A common opinion among researchers is: “Yes! There is a next step and it’s attention!” The idea is to let every step of an RNN pick information to look at from some larger collection of information. For example, if you are using an RNN to create a caption describing an image, it might pick a part of the image to look at for every word it outputs. In fact, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044v2.pdf\">Xu, <em>et al.</em> (2015)</a> do exactly this – it might be a fun starting point if you want to explore attention! There’s been a number of really exciting results using attention, and it seems like a lot more are around the corner…</p>\n",
       "<p>Attention isn’t the only exciting thread in RNN research. For example, Grid LSTMs by <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.01526v1.pdf\">Kalchbrenner, <em>et al.</em> (2015)</a> seem extremely promising. Work using RNNs in generative models – such as <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04623.pdf\">Gregor, <em>et al.</em> (2015)</a>, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02216v3.pdf\">Chung, <em>et al.</em> (2015)</a>, or <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.7610v3.pdf\">Bayer & Osendorfer (2015)</a>  – also seems very interesting. The last few years have been an exciting time for recurrent neural networks, and the coming ones promise to only be more so!</p>\n",

    "neither of those decisions are hard/fast rules. You could make alternate decisions and still train the network successfully. I chose them based on some internal heuristics on the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) I discuss this some in the last video, but the big reason is that I believe that most of the network’s power is going to come from a linear correlation (direct correlation), which means adding a non-linearity can make learning take longer and increases the likelihood of overfitting. It’s still doable and with the right regularization I’m sure it’d work fine, but it’s a needless over-complication. Furthermore, as a learning exercise, this also prepares you for another, identically shaped, network called word2vec which has some very nice principles. Networks like this are actually just doing a linear compression of the correlation matrix between the input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "in mini-project solution 3, why were the weights from inputs layer to hidden layer initialized to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Highly related to the first question. The output layer is a single vector, which means that the decision boundary is a single plane, more or less. 99% of the learning in this network is bout moving words to one side or the other of that plane. So, you can randomly put words all over the vector space so that many of them have a long way to travel to get to one side or the other of the plane (meanwhile the plane is moving to try to fit as many as possible… further complicating the issue), or you can just put all the words in the same spot (0,0,0,0,0..etc), and then after the first time you “bump” each words in either the positive/negative direction you’ve already split them quite well allowing for an effective (albeit tight) decision boundary. So, long story short, in this case, I felt that learning would happen a lot faster. However, it’s not a hard and fast rule."
